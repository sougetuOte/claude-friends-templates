## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Will v2.5.0 break my existing workflow?
**A:** No. With `settings-minimal.json`, you get the same workflow plus auto-handover and security. Other features are optional.

### Q: How long does migration take?
**A:**
- Minimal: 15 minutes
- Progressive: 1-2 weeks of gradual adoption
- Full: 1-2 hours for complete setup

### Q: Can I rollback if something goes wrong?
**A:** Yes. Simply restore from backup or use `settings-minimal.json` for instant simplification.

### Q: Do I need all the new features?
**A:** No. Most users only need 20% of features for 80% of the value. Start small.

### Q: Will my existing agents (Planner/Builder) still work?
**A:** Yes. v2.5.0 enhances them without changing their core behavior.

### Q: What about my custom hooks and scripts?
**A:** They remain compatible. New hooks are additive, not replacements.

### Q: Is the parallel execution feature stable?
**A:** Yes, but it's optional. Only enable if you have tasks that benefit from parallelization.

### Q: How do I know which features to adopt?
**A:** Start with minimal configuration. If you find yourself wanting more automation, gradually enable features.
