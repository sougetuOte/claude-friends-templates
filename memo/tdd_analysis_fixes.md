# TDD Checker Test Analysis and Fixes

## Current Test Status
- **Total Tests**: 60
- **Passing**: 26 (43.3%)
- **Failing**: 34 (56.7%)

## Critical Issue Categories

### 1. Directory Creation Issues (Tests #4, #27, #30)
**Problem**: Tests failing because parent directories don't exist when creating test files.
**Solution**: Add `mkdir -p` calls in test setup or fix the `find_test_file` function to handle missing directories.

### 2. Design Compliance Features Missing (Tests #12, #13, #15, #36-39)
**Problem**: Design compliance functions exist but don't return expected messages.
**Root Cause**: Functions don't output required strings like "DESIGN_DOC_FOUND", "DESIGN_MISMATCH", "ADR_COMPLIANT", etc.

### 3. Hook Processing Issues (Tests #20-21, #44-47)
**Problem**: Hook function doesn't output expected status messages.
**Root Cause**: Missing output messages for ignored files, concurrency handling, IDE integration, etc.

### 4. Advanced Warning Features Missing (Tests #40-43)
**Problem**: Warning system is basic and doesn't include advanced features.
**Root Cause**: `generate_warning` function lacks code snippets, severity levels, suggested actions, and aggregation.

### 5. Configuration Issues (Tests #48-51)
**Problem**: Configuration loading doesn't handle edge cases properly.
**Root Cause**: Missing error handling, environment overrides, and validation.

### 6. Language Support Issues (Tests #28, #30, #32)
**Problem**: Some language-specific test discovery patterns are incomplete.
**Root Cause**: Missing or incorrect patterns for Java/Maven, PHP, and symlink handling.

## Fix Priority (Green Phase)

3. Fix hook processing output messages

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
4. Improve warning system
5. Add configuration error handling
6. Complete language support

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
7. Add caching, performance optimizations
8. Add integration features (ESLint, coverage, etc.)
