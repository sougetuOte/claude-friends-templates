<!-- Placeholder for quickstart GIF/video - see docs/QUICKSTART_MEDIA.md for guidelines -->

```bash
# Morning: Your AI Planner organizes the day
$ /agent:planner
"Let's tackle the authentication system today. I've broken it down into 3 phases..."

# Planning a new feature? Planner automatically switches to design mode
"I want to add user notifications"
"Switching to Feature Design Mode. Let me create a detailed spec with diagrams..."

# Seamless handoff to your AI Builder
$ /agent:builder
"Got it! Starting with the login API. I'll follow the plan and implement JWT..."

# Hit an error? Builder automatically switches to debug mode
"TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"
"Entering Debug Mode. Let me analyze this error and trace its root cause..."

# Your code gets written, tested, debugged, and reviewed automatically
```

enqueue_task "echo 'Running tests'"
enqueue_task "echo 'Linting code'"
execute_parallel 3  # Runs all 3 tasks simultaneously
```

### üî¥üü¢‚úÖ **TDD Design Check (Sprint 2.3)**

```

**Parallel Processing Example:**
```bash
# Execute multiple code quality checks simultaneously
source .claude/hooks/parallel/parallel-executor.sh

**üìö New to Claude Friends?** Start with our **[Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)** - it shows you exactly what to use and what to ignore!

## üöÄ Quick Start

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start (5 minutes to your first AI-powered development)

### Prerequisites
- **Required**: Claude Code v1.0+, Git, Bash
- **Optional**: Bats (for running developer tests)
- **üìù Note**: **Bats is NOT required for general use**. All features work perfectly without Bats. See [Test System Guide](.claude/tests/README.md) for details.

### 1. Get the Template & Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup your project
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-friends-templates.git .

# Run the setup script for automatic configuration (NEW!)
./setup.sh
# The script will:
# - Ask for your project name and description
# - Choose English or Japanese as default
# - Update CLAUDE.md automatically
# - Initialize git repository
# - Set up proper permissions

# Or manually if you prefer:
# rm -rf .git && git init
# For Japanese: mv README_ja.md README.md && mv CLAUDE_ja.md CLAUDE.md
```

### 2. Tell AI About Your Project (30 seconds)
Edit the first 2 lines in `CLAUDE.md`:
```markdown
# [Project Name]                 ‚Üê Replace with: My Todo App
## Project Overview
[Write a concise description...] ‚Üê Replace with: A simple todo list application
```

(Don't worry about the rest of CLAUDE.md - it contains useful settings that help the AI understand your project better)

### 3. Start Development with Agent-First Methodology

#### ‚≠ê Recommended: Agent-First Development Flow
```bash
# Start with Agent First - it ensures proper methodology:
/agent:first

# Agent First will guide you through:
# ‚úÖ Requirements Definition ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Implementation
# ‚úÖ Quality gates at each stage
# ‚úÖ Automatic progression to the right specialist agent
```

**Why Agent First?** It prevents jumping straight to implementation without proper planning.

#### Alternative: Direct Agent Access (if requirements/design ready)
```bash
# For planning and design work
/agent:planner
"I have complete requirements. Let's create the technical design."

# For implementation work (only after planning)
/agent:builder
"Let's implement the user authentication system."
```

### 4. Development Flow

#### Project Development Phases
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Requirements<br/>Planner] -->|"Next?"| B[Design<br/>Planner]
    B -->|"Next?"| C[Task Generation<br/>Planner]
    C -->|Switch| D[Implementation<br/>Builder]
    D -->|Complete| E[Next Phase]
```

**Phase 1: Requirements** - Planner asks questions and creates requirements.md
**Phase 2: Design** - Planner creates architecture with Mermaid diagrams
**Phase 3: Tasks** - Planner generates TDD tasks with Red-Green-Refactor
**Phase 4: Build** - Builder implements with strict TDD practices

```bash
# When ready to implement:
/agent:builder
"Let's start with the first task!"
```

### That's It! üéâ

Your AI team is ready. Just chat naturally - they understand context!

**Quick Tips:**
- `/project:focus` - Get back on track when distracted
- `/project:daily` - Quick retrospectives
- Ask "What would you recommend?" when unsure

### üîó Hooks System Quick Start

Enable developer experience automation features (optional but recommended):

```bash
# Test the hooks system
.claude/scripts/test-hooks.sh

# Check performance metrics
.claude/tests/performance/comprehensive-performance-test.sh

# Verify security features
.claude/scripts/test-security.sh
```

The hooks system includes:
- Automatic agent switching with `/agent:planner` or `/agent:builder`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files

This project uses several configuration files to maintain code quality and consistency:

### `.editorconfig`
Ensures consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs:
- **Python files**: 4-space indentation (PEP 8 compliant)
- **YAML/JSON files**: 2-space indentation
- **Line endings**: Unix-style LF for cross-platform compatibility
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 for all text files
- **Max line length**: 88 characters (Black/Ruff default)

**Purpose**: Prevents whitespace and indentation issues when multiple developers work on the same project.

### `pyproject.toml`
Modern Python project configuration (PEP 518/621):
- **Project metadata**: Name, version, description, authors
- **Build system**: setuptools configuration for package building
- **Dependencies**: Optional dependency groups (dev, test, quality)
- **Tool configurations**:
  - **Ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter (replaces flake8, isort)
  - **MyPy**: Static type checker with strict mode enabled
  - **Pytest**: Test runner configuration with markers and coverage
  - **Coverage**: 90% minimum coverage requirement

**Purpose**: Centralizes all Python tooling configuration in a single standardized file.

### `.gitignore`
Specifies files and directories Git should ignore:
- **Python artifacts**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, virtual environments
- **IDE files**: `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, editor swap files
- **Build outputs**: `dist/`, `build/`, `*.egg-info/`
- **Coverage reports**: `htmlcov/`, `.coverage`
- **Security scans**: `.claude/security/scan-results/`
- **Temporary files**: Test artifacts, debug files, logs

**Purpose**: Keeps the repository clean by excluding generated files and sensitive information.

### Usage

These configuration files work automatically with supported tools:

```bash
# EditorConfig: Supported natively by PyCharm, VS Code, etc.
# No additional setup required

# Ruff: Lint and format code
ruff check .                    # Check for issues
ruff format .                   # Format code

# MyPy: Type checking
mypy .claude/scripts/           # Check type annotations

# Pytest: Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=.claude/scripts --cov-report=html
```
