## 💡 What if you had AI teammates who never sleep?

Imagine having a **Project Planner** who organizes your ideas and a **Code Builder** who implements them flawlessly. That's **Claude Friends** - your AI development team in a box.

### ✨ See the Magic in Action

```bash
# Morning: Your AI Planner organizes the day
$ /agent:planner
"Let's tackle the authentication system today. I've broken it down into 3 phases..."

# Planning a new feature? Planner automatically switches to design mode
"I want to add user notifications"
"Switching to Feature Design Mode. Let me create a detailed spec with diagrams..."

# Seamless handoff to your AI Builder  
$ /agent:builder
"Got it! Starting with the login API. I'll follow the plan and implement JWT..."

# Hit an error? Builder automatically switches to debug mode
"TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"
"Entering Debug Mode. Let me analyze this error and trace its root cause..."

# Your code gets written, tested, debugged, and reviewed automatically
```
