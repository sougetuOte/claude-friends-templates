## ðŸ“‹ Next Step: Design Phase

### Requirements are now complete! Time to move to the design phase.

1. **Use the Design Generation Template**
   - Location: `.claude/shared/templates/design/`
   - Purpose: Transform these requirements into technical design

2. **What to expect in Design Phase**
   - Architecture decisions
   - Component design
   - Interface definitions
   - Data models
   - Technical specifications

3. **Handover to Planner Agent**
   ```
   /agent:planner
   "Requirements are complete. Please proceed with design phase using the requirements above."
   ```

### Design Phase Checklist
- [ ] All functional requirements have been captured
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are clear
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Stakeholders have reviewed and approved

---
*Good requirements lead to good design. Good design leads to good implementation.*
